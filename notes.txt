# General structure

The stack has stack_vals. Some stack vals are named addresses, some are components. But some components
might also be addresses themselves. So we build a graph.

dest is the top of the stack.

# TODO

1. Needed annotations for wasm_func_env:
    - Used out of cut order (to make locals)
    - Deref'd args
        - if an arg is deref'd/Read in all cases, make two locals for it instead of just the addr
        - conversely, if a cut variable is Read in all cases, we don't have to allocate it
2. negative polarity
